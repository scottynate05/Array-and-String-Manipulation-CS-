# You are given a parentheses sequence, check if it's regular.

# Example

# For s = "()()(())", the output should be
# validParenthesesSequence(s) = true;
# For s = "()()())", the output should be
# validParenthesesSequence(s) = false.
# Input/Output

# [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

# [input] string s

# A string, consisting only of '(' and ')'.

# Guaranteed constraints:
# 0 ≤ s.length ≤ 105.

# [output] boolean

# true is the sequence is regular and false otherwise.
